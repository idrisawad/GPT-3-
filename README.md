1. Overview
The Deep Learning Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot that uses GPT-3 to generate responses to user inputs. The chatbot can be fine-tuned using a dataset of text inputs and corresponding outputs. The chatbot can also learn from the internet and remember every sentence ever talked. With the above-mentioned instructions, you should be able to use the chatbot effectively.

2. Installation
To use the Deep Learning Chatbot, you will need to install the following dependencies:

nltk: A library for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
sklearn: A library for machine learning tasks such as feature extraction and similarity measurement.
transformers: A library for state-of-the-art natural language processing models such as GPT-3.
torch: A library for deep learning tasks such as model fine-tuning and training.
You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install nltk sklearn transformers torch
3. Usage
3.1 Initialization
To use the chatbot, you need to create an instance of the DeepLearningChatbot class:

Copy code
chatbot = DeepLearningChatbot()
3.2 Learning from the Internet
To learn from the internet, you can use the learn_from_internet method, which takes a string of text as a parameter:

Copy code
text = "This is an example of text that the chatbot can learn from the internet"
chatbot.learn_from_internet(text)
3.3 Fine-tuning the GPT-3 model
To fine-tune the GPT-3 model, you can use the fine_tune_gpt3 method, which takes the following parameters:

model_name: The name of the GPT-3 model to use (e.g., "distilgpt2").
train_texts: A list of texts to use for fine-tuning the model.
train_labels: A list of labels corresponding to the texts.
batch_size: The number of samples to use in each training iteration.
device: The device to use for training (e.g., "cuda" for a GPU).
Copy code
model_name = "distilgpt2"
train_texts = ["This is an example of text that the chatbot can learn from","This is an example of text that the chatbot can learn from"]
train_labels = [0,1]
batch

Copy code
batch_size = 4
device = "cuda"
chatbot.fine_tune_gpt3(model_name, train_texts, train_labels, batch_size, device)
3.4 Chatting
To start chatting with the chatbot, you can use the chat method:

Copy code
chatbot.chat()
This will start a loop where the user can input a sentence, and the chatbot will generate a response. The loop will continue until the user inputs "bye".

3.5 Saving and loading the fine-tuned model
The chatbot allows you to save and load the fine-tuned model, optimizer, and scheduler state, respectively.
You can use the save_model method which takes the path where the model should be saved, and load_model takes the path where the model is saved.

Copy code
path = "path/to/save/model"
chatbot.save_model(path)
and to load the model:

Copy code
path = "path/to/save/model"
chatbot.load_model(path)
4. Troubleshooting
If the chatbot is not generating good responses, it might be because the fine-tuning process did not converge, or the dataset was not adequate.
If the chatbot is not learning from the internet, it might be because the text passed to the learn_from_internet method is not adequate.
If the code is not running correctly, it might be because the dependencies are not correctly installed, or the versions are not compatible.
5. Conclusion

The Deep Learning Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot that uses GPT-3 to generate responses to user inputs. The chatbot can be fine-tuned using a dataset of text inputs and corresponding outputs. The chatbot can also learn from the internet and remember every sentence ever talked. With the above-mentioned instructions, you should be able to use the chatbot effectively.

In this code, I have used the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-3 model on the chatbot's learned data. I've added a new method fine_tune_gpt3 that takes the model name, train texts and train labels as input. This method instantiates the GPT-3 model and tokenizer, then it prepares the data for fine-tuning and fine-tune the model.

In the chat method, instead of using the Tf-Idf similarity to find the most similar sentence, I've used the fine-tuned GPT-3 model to generate a response.

I've also added a new method called _normalize that is used to normalize the user's input and the sentences. This method is used to clean the text by lowercasing it, removing punctuation and tokenizing it.


Here is a detailed preparation guide with code hints to run the Deep Learning Chatbot code properly:

Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install nltk
pip install scikit-learn
pip install transformers
pip install torch
Download the necessary NLTK data:
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
Load the fine-tuned GPT-3 model:
Copy code
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "openai/gpt3-squad2"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
Prepare the data for fine-tuning, this step is optional if you don't want to fine-tune the model:
Copy code
train_texts = [ "code snippet 1 in language A", "code snippet 2 in language B", ...]
train_labels = [ "language A", "language B", ...]
Initialize the chatbot:
Copy code
chatbot = DeepLearningChatbot()
chatbot.fine_tune_gpt3(model_name, train_texts, train_labels, batch_size=4, device='cuda')
Use the chatbot to generate code snippets in different programming languages:
Copy code
code_snippet = chatbot._get_response("Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum in Python")
To check if the code generated is correct, you can use a linter or a formatter:
Copy code
from py_linter import PyLinter

linter = PyLinter()
linter.lint(code_snippet)
Please note that this is a very high-level guide, and there may be additional steps and considerations that need to be taken depending on your specific use case.
Also, make sure you have a good understanding of the programming languages and tools that you are using.

Here is a single command line that can be used to install the required libraries, download the necessary NLTK data, load the fine-tuned GPT-3 model, and initialize the chatbot:

pip install nltk scikit-learn transformers torch; python -c "import nltk;nltk.download('punkt');nltk.download('wordnet');from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer;model=AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('openai/gpt3-squad2');tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('openai/gpt3-squad2');from deep_learning_chatbot import DeepLearningChatbot;chatbot = DeepLearningChatbot();chatbot.fine_tune_gpt3('openai/gpt3-squad2', train_texts, train_labels, batch_size=4, device='cuda')"

This command will install the required libraries, download the necessary NLTK data, load the fine-tuned GPT-3 model, and initialize the chatbot.

It's worth mentioning that this code is an example, and it might need further adjustments and fine-tuning to work correctly. Moreover, the fine-tuning process might take a while depending on the size of your dataset and the computational resources you have.

How to create training data texts?
There are several ways to create training data texts for fine-tuning the GPT-3 model in the Deep Learning Chatbot code. Here are a few examples:

Scraping: You can use web scraping techniques to gather code snippets from websites such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, and other code repositories.

Manual Creation: You can manually create code snippets in different programming languages. This can be time-consuming but it guarantees that the data is relevant to your task and that it is of high quality.

Crowdsourcing: You can use platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or Upwork to outsource the creation of the training data to a large number of people.

Synthetic Data: You can use a code generator to create synthetic data. This is useful if you have a specific type of code or a specific programming language in mind.

Open-source Datasets: There are datasets that are available on-line like https://github.com/mhagiwara/deep_learning_code_completion

Mix of the above: You can use a combination of the above methods to create a diverse and high-quality training dataset.

It's important to ensure that the data is relevant to your task, that it is of high quality, and that it is diverse in terms of programming languages and code types. Also, you should consider the size of the dataset, the larger the dataset, the better the model will perform.

How to fine-tune?

Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model like GPT-3 involves training the model on a new dataset for a specific task. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

Data preparation: The first step is to prepare the data for fine-tuning. This includes cleaning and pre-processing the data, such as tokenizing the text, lowercasing it, and removing punctuation. You will also need to split your data into training and validation sets.

Model instantiation: You need to instantiate the pre-trained model and tokenizer from the transformers library. You can do this by specifying the model's name and loading the pre-trained weights.

Data loading: The next step is to load the data into the model for training. You need to convert the data into the format that the model expects, which is typically a tensor. This is done by tokenizing the text, and encoding it into numerical values.

Fine-tuning: Once the data is loaded, you can fine-tune the model by training it on the new data. The fine_tune method of the transformers library can be used for this step. The method takes the input_ids (the encoded text) and labels as input. You can set the number of training epochs and batch size as well.

Evaluation: After the fine-tuning is complete, you should evaluate the model's performance on the validation set. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

Hyperparameter tuning: You can fine-tune the model further by tuning the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. This can help you to find the best set of hyperparameters for your specific task.

Saving and loading the model: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the fine-tuned model, you should save it for future use. You can save the model and tokenizer using the save_pretrained method of the transformers library. You can then use the from_pretrained method to load the model and tokenizer.

Please note that fine-tuning a pre-trained language model can be computationally intensive and requires a powerful GPU, and a lot of memory. It's also important to mention that fine-tuning a pre-trained model requires a good amount of data and computational resources, and you should consider this when deciding on whether to use the OpenAI API or to train your own model.
