# GPT-3-1.3

GPT-3⅓ is a language generation model which has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, and can generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics. 

GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is a state-of-the-art language generation model developed by OpenAI. It has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, and can generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics. It has been used to create chatbots, generate text for language translation, summarization, and question-answering, and can also perform tasks such as text completion, text classification, and text generation.

GPT-3⅓ is a language generation model which is  deep learning chatbot in Python that can learn from the internet and remember every sentence it has talked.
It has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, and can generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics, inspired, byn abd created of the methodology, of OpenAIs GPT-3. 


In this code, I have used the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-3 model on the chatbot's learned data. I've added a new method fine_tune_gpt3 that takes the model name, train texts and train labels as input. This method instantiates the GPT-3 model and tokenizer, then it prepares the data for fine-tuning and fine-tune the model.

In the chat method, instead of using the Tf-Idf similarity to find the most similar sentence, I've used the fine-tuned GPT-3 model to generate a response.

I've also added a new method called _normalize that is used to normalize the user's input and the sentences. This method is used to clean the text by lowercasing it, removing punctuation and tokenizing it.

It's worth mentioning that this code is an example, and it might need further adjustments and fine-tuning to work correctly. Moreover, the fine-tuning process might take a while depending on the size of your dataset and the computational resources you have.


How to fine-tune?

Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model like GPT-3 involves training the model on a new dataset for a specific task. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

Data preparation: The first step is to prepare the data for fine-tuning. This includes cleaning and pre-processing the data, such as tokenizing the text, lowercasing it, and removing punctuation. You will also need to split your data into training and validation sets.

Model instantiation: You need to instantiate the pre-trained model and tokenizer from the transformers library. You can do this by specifying the model's name and loading the pre-trained weights.

Data loading: The next step is to load the data into the model for training. You need to convert the data into the format that the model expects, which is typically a tensor. This is done by tokenizing the text, and encoding it into numerical values.

Fine-tuning: Once the data is loaded, you can fine-tune the model by training it on the new data. The fine_tune method of the transformers library can be used for this step. The method takes the input_ids (the encoded text) and labels as input. You can set the number of training epochs and batch size as well.

Evaluation: After the fine-tuning is complete, you should evaluate the model's performance on the validation set. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

Hyperparameter tuning: You can fine-tune the model further by tuning the hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. This can help you to find the best set of hyperparameters for your specific task.

Saving and loading the model: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the fine-tuned model, you should save it for future use. You can save the model and tokenizer using the save_pretrained method of the transformers library. You can then use the from_pretrained method to load the model and tokenizer.

Please note that fine-tuning a pre-trained language model can be computationally intensive and requires a powerful GPU, and a lot of memory. It's also important to mention that fine-tuning a pre-trained model requires a good amount of data and computational resources, and you should consider this when deciding on whether to use the OpenAI API or to train your own model.

I can provide you with the information on how to train an AI model using the code you provided.

The code you provided is an example of a deep learning chatbot that uses a fine-tuned GPT-3 model to generate responses. To train this model, you would need to:

Prepare a dataset: Gather a large dataset of text data that is relevant to the task you want the chatbot to perform. This dataset should include text data that the chatbot can learn from and text data that you can use to evaluate the model's performance.

Fine-tune the GPT-3 model: Use the fine_tune_gpt3() method provided in the code to fine-tune the GPT-3 model on your dataset. This method takes the model name, train texts, and train labels as input.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a separate dataset. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

Hyperparameter tuning: Try different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs to find the best set of hyperparameters for your specific task.

Saving the model: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the fine-tuned model, you should save it for future use. You can use the save_pretrained method of the transformers library to save the model and tokenizer.
