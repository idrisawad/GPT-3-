To improve the code:

Data: The more data the chatbot has to learn from, the more accurate its responses will be. You can try to gather more data from the internet to improve the chatbot's understanding of language.

Pre-processing: The code is performing some basic pre-processing on the input text, such as tokenizing and lowercasing the text. You can further improve the pre-processing by using more advanced techniques such as stemming and removing stop words.

Similarity measure: The code is currently using Tf-Idf and cosine similarity to find the most similar sentence to the user's input. You can try experimenting with other similarity measures such as Jaccard similarity or Euclidean distance.

Language model: GPT-3 is a recent language model that can be used to generate human-like text on a wide variety of topics. You can fine-tune a GPT-3 to your dataset and use it as a language model for your bot, which will make the bot more human-like in its responses.

Conversational Memory: The bot is currently not maintaining the conversation history, so it does not have any context of the previous conversation. You can use a database or a data structure to keep track of the previous conversation, so the bot can refer to it and generate more contextually relevant responses.

Error Handling: The code currently doesn't have any error handling mechanism, which means it will crash if there is an error. It is important to have a proper error handling mechanism to make sure the chatbot runs smoothly.

Testing: The code should be thoroughly tested with a variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly and producing accurate responses.

Intents and Entities: It is a good practice to use intents and entities to understand the user's intent behind the message. This will help the bot to provide more accurate responses.

Handling Multiple Inputs: The current code can only handle a single message at a time, it doesn't handle multiple inputs. You can work on this to improve the code.

User Experience: The code could be further improved by working on the user interface, to make the conversation more natural, and more user-friendly.

Could we improve the Language model as GPT-3 without using open ai API?

It is certainly possible to improve a language model without using the OpenAI API. 

Here are a few ways to do it:

Fine-tuning: You can fine-tune a pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3, on your own dataset. This will allow the model to learn the specific characteristics and language patterns of your data, which can improve its performance. There are libraries like HuggingFace's transformers that provide pre-trained models and easy fine-tuning functionality.

Transfer Learning: You can use the pre-trained weights of a language model, such as GPT-3, as the starting point for training a new model on your own dataset. This is known as transfer learning, and it can be more efficient than training a model from scratch.

Data augmentation: You can use data augmentation techniques, such as backtranslation, to increase the size of your dataset and improve the model's performance. This method can be particularly useful if you have a small dataset.

Pretraining: You can train your own language model from scratch, using a large dataset. For example, using a large corpus of text data such as Wikipedia, and then fine-tune it for your specific task.

Ensemble models: You can use an ensemble of models like using GPT-2 and BERT, to achieve better results.

(For training a large language model like GPT-3 can be computationally intensive, and may require a powerful GPU and a large amount of memory!)

It's important to mention that fine-tuning a pre-trained language model requires a good amount of data and computational resources, and you should consider this when deciding on whether to use the OpenAI API or to train your own model.
